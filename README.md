# Doctor Consultation Fee Prediction Web App

Welcome to the Doctor Consultation Fee Prediction web application! This app is designed to predict the consultation fees of a doctor based on various inputs using a Random Forest Regressor model.

## Overview

This project utilizes a machine learning model created in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The algorithm employed for prediction is the Random Forest Regressor, which is trained on relevant features to estimate the consultation fees.

## Technology Stack

- **Model Development:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Deployment:** Render
